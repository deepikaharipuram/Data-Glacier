# Data Science:: Healthcare - Persistency of a drug project

## Overview
This project aims to predict drug persistency among patients, a crucial factor in healthcare analytics. 
Collaborating with ABC Pharma, we're employing data-driven approaches to understand medication adherence patterns.

## Project Background
The persistency of medication usage is key to both patient outcomes and effective healthcare management. 
Using data science, this project seeks to identify key predictors of medication adherence.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the `Healthcare_dataset.xlsx`. Access the dataset for this project ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P_oMc6gOBlhw6dY5PxaqxV2swdHMUooK/view)). 


## Objectives
The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the `Persistency_Flag`, indicating the likelihood of patients adhering to their medication regimen.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Comprehensive data cleaning and normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Optimizing data attributes for better model performance.
4. **Model Development and Selection**: Testing various algorithms to find the most effective predictive model.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Running the Project
- **Environment**: The project is developed in Google Colab.
- **Dependencies**: All necessary Python libraries are listed and can be installed directly in the Colab notebook.
- **Execution**: Upload the dataset to Google Colab or integrate with Google Drive for direct access.

## Key Features
The dataset includes demographics, clinical measures, treatment history, and adherence metrics, providing a comprehensive dataset for predictive modeling.

## Performance Metrics
We evaluate our model using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores to ensure robustness and reliability.
